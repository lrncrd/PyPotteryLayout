Create artefacts table effortless

</div>


## Introduction

Producing publication-quality catalogues of archaeological artefacts is often a time-consuming process, requiring both precision in presentation and consistency across large datasets. **PyPotteryLayout** is designed to streamline this workflow by combining automation with professional publishing standards.

Instead of manually arranging artefact images, adjusting captions, and aligning scale bars, researchers can generate layouts in minutes while retaining full control over the final output. The software produces clean, publication-ready figures that meet the expectations of academic journals, site reports, and edited volumes. Its vector-based exports (SVG) ensure that images, scale bars, and captions remain sharp and editable at any stage of the editorial process.

This efficiency makes the tool particularly valuable for projects with large assemblages, where hundreds of objects must be documented quickly without sacrificing visual quality. At the same time, the flexibility of SVG editing allows archaeologists and illustrators to refine details, translate captions, or adjust layouts for specific publication styles.
