Module Overview
---------------

PyPotteryLayout consists of two main modules:

* **backend_logic**: Core image processing and layout generation functionality
* **gui_app**: Tkinter-based graphical user interface

The modules are designed to work together but can also be used independently.
The backend_logic module can be imported and used programmatically without the GUI.
